        <p itemprop="description">
  
        Brown butter chocolate chip cookies are an elevated version of the classic dessert, featuring a rich, nutty, and caramelized flavor derived from browning the butter. The taste is complex, often described as toffee-like and nutty, with a savory depth that balances the sweetness of the sugar and chocolate.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol itemprop="recipeInstructions">
          <li>
            <strong>Brown the butter.</strong>
            First brown the butter. Follow the instructions in this post here to learn how to brown butter. It’s easy! Brown specks and a dense golden foam will form at the surface when it is nearly ready.
            Pour it out into a clean bowl and let it cool for 10 minutes. This whole process takes around 8–10 minutes. Immediately pour it into a large mixing bowl, then place it in the freezer for about
            10 minutes until cool and thick. It should be cool enough that it is opaque and firm, but not hard. If you freeze it for too long, it will be difficult to mix in the other ingredients.
            If you care to measure, the butter should read 34°C or 93°F on a thermometer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combine dry ingredients.</strong>
            Combine flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and whisk well to blend evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blend butter and sugar.</strong>
            Combine cooled brown butter with both sugars in a large bowl and mix gently to combine. It should look thick like wet sand.
            You can also mix it in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed for 20 seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add wet ingredients.</strong>
            Add the egg, milk and vanilla and mix it in until well incorporated and creamy-looking. Do not beat vigorously at this stage because if it is cold in your house, the butterfat will firm up and become stiff.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add dry ingredients.</strong>
            Add flour mixture and fold it in or mix on low just until mostly combined, then add the chocolate chunks before all of the flour is incorporated and continue mixing until they are evenly distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chill the dough.</strong>
            Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for 1–2 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bake.</strong>
            Portion dough and roll into smooth balls. Place them onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them 3 inches apart. Do not flatten. Bake for 8–10 minutes until golden on top,
            browned around the edges and soft in the middle. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes before carefully transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
          </li>
